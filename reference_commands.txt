Some helpful commands for working with 
- Heroku
- Docker

--- HEROKU ---
Make sure you are within the correct directory when setting up your Heroku project

-- Pushing changes to Heroku
git push heroku main

-- Restart your application
heroku ps:restart

-- Check end of logs
heroku logs -t


--- DOCKER ---
Working in docker you can either launch a container attached or detached from the terminal

- Launch docker container in detached mode: you can use this terminal as usual
docker-compose up -d

- Launch container normally (attached form)
docker-compose up

Benefit of launching detached is that you can check the status of your docker container and
run other commands without a second terminal window running.

- Check the status of your Docker containers and get their ID
docker ps

- To enter a container's terminal to look at internals
docker exec -it <container id> bash

The -it flag standard for interactive mode, which allows you to enter the container's filesystem
